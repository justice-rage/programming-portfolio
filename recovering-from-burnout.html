      <hr>
        <p>From the day I decided to break into the tech industry I knew I had a daunting journey ahead of me. Already my professional life was demanding more time as the pandemic spread across the globe, and I was given the responsibility of mitigating COVID outbreaks for high priority clients with my own team. Every day, whether it was 12 or 14 hours I returned home and viewed bashing my intellect up against the arcane domain of programming until my eyes burned a badge of honor. I no longer consider working myself to utter exhaustion on top of my current work a badge of honor. I consider it stupid.</p>

        <p>I am still in love with my chosen path, but I will be putting a large emphasis on health and sustainability as it comes to acquiring my first professional programming position. In my first couple of technical interviews when asked basic questions such as creating a function that reverses a string I simply blanked. This happened multiple times. After taking a hard look at myself after the ninth interview, I realized I wasn't taking care of myself. As a result I was tired and my mind wasn't as sharp as I'm accustom to from the prolonged strain of relentlessly pursuing my passion and the extreme hours the pandemic has caused in my current professional life.</p>

        <p>I'm satisfied to say after leisurely programming and exploring other domains of technology such as Blockchain I'm ready to get back to work. However, this time around I will be pursuing my passion in a healthy and sustainable manner. I now understand why burnout in the development community exists, and right alongside it bug debt.</p>
