      <hr>
        <p>Since launching my first website I've felt much more confident pursuing junior roles in software and technology in general. However, as I've begun throwing myself into the applicant pool the more I've realized I need to pick up JavaScript to increase my odds of landing my first role. If you read my first blog post you may of surmised I'd begin studying JavaScript, and as correct as that is I was planning to take things slow. Whether it's healthy this recent revelation of just how often and valued JavaScript is alongside Python has lit a fire under me to get to work, and to meet my goal of fluency I've enrolled in my first Udemy course.</p>

        <p>"The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann is the course I enrolled in, and so far I'm absolutely loving it. As an instructor he is extremely direct, clear, and relaxed. Furthermore, I'm really enjoying JavaScript as a language. As much as I adore Python it is quite refreshing to try my hands at another language. Additionally, I'm just excited to be learning the language after discovering my equal fondness for the frontend and backend while creating my personal django website.</p>

        <p>This isn't meant to be a long post, but moreso an update. For one, I'm trying to make this a habit for accountability reasons and two I imagine it'd be nice for any potential employers to see what I'm up to as of late. Anyways, as always thank you for taking the time to read this. There will be more updates to what I'm up to in addition to my overall progress personally and professionally in the near future.</p>
