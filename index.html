  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Background</li>
    <p>I have moved many times, having lived on the West and East Coasts, as well as in the South. I believe being comfortable in not knowing, being wrong, and pursuing intelligent failure is paramount to effective creation, innovation, leadership, and lifelong learning. As the complexity of our reality increases, so do our problems. Thus, as a young professional, I aim to harness the grit and adaptability developed throughout my life so that I can acquire the skills necessary to assist in overcoming the ever-growing problems our society faces.
