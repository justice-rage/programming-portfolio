Already my professional life was demanding more time as the pandemic spread across the globe, and I was given the responsibility of mitigating COVID outbreaks for high priority clients with my own team.

      <p>After months of working on the website you are now on it is what I call, production ready. I could have made my life easier by deploying a barebones site, but I wanted my first website to be built from Django. Furthermore, as much as Iâ€™ve wanted to rapidly apply to software developer roles, and honestly any position that would get my foot in the door of technology it just felt strange to apply wit...</p>
